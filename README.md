# 📄 Resume Tailor AI

An open-source application that automatically tailors resumes for specific job applications using AI analysis. The project combines a browser extension, server-side processing, and PDF generation capabilities.

Job applications have become incomprehensibly complex, and AI ATS systems have become the standard. It is impossible to manually tailor resumes for each job application, and all available solutions are either too expensive or require significant manual work.

This is an attempt at an open-source solution for all to use.

> 🚧 This is a very early stage project. There are many things that need to be done, and there will be many bugs. I will be updating this README as I make progress.

## Templates

There is currently only 1 template: "default". You can create your own theme by creating a new directory in `templates/`.

The process is straight forward. Create a new directory in `templates/` and add your template files. The template files should be named `index.hbs` and `styles.css`. 

```
├── templates
│   ├── [template-name]
│   │   ├── index.hbs
│   │   ├── styles.css
```
